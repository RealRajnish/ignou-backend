# IGNOU-PROJECT

The project is divided in three sections. Here I am using common server for both the client and admin side.

- admin
- client
- server

## Live Demo

[Click here for client side](https://rj-cutepets.onrender.com/) [Alternate link](https://rj-cutepets.cyclic.app/)

[Click here for admin side](https://cutepets-admin.onrender.com/)

Demo Credentials for client: 
- user: abcd@gmail.com
- password: abcd

admin side is password protected please contact for a demo password through any of the social links, Here I have used render free-tier services which makes the server sleep on inactivity for a long time. It takes about 15-20 seconds to restart the server for the first time. So, kindly wait.
